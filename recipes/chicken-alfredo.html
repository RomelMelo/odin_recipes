<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a dish consisting of <i>chicken</i>, <i>Fettuccine noodles</i>, and <i>Alfredo sauce</i>, that is made using 
        <i>Parmagiano Reggiano</i>. This dish is great to pair with a dry white wine, like Pinot Grigio. Broccoli is my favorite
        vegetable and it's great to pair with this meal. The most important part of this dish, that many people tend to neglect,
         is making the alfredo sauce from scratch! This is an extra step that will take the taste of your dish up a notch!  </p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Ground Black Pepper</li>
            <li>12 ounces of fettuccine noodles</li>
            <li>Olive oil, for tossing</li>
            <li>2 chicken breast</li>
            <li>1 stick of unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 cups of heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 pinches of freshly ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of freshly grated Parmigano Reggiano</li>
        </ul>
      
<h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions
                until al dente (tender but still slightly firm). Drain and toss with a splash of oil.</li>
            <li>Cut the chicken into strips (slice into size of your liking), and lay them on a plate or a sheet of waxed paper.
                Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to 
                medium-high and add the chicken in 1 layer. Cook, without moving the pieces, until the underside has browned, 
                1 to 2 minutes. Flip the pieces, and cook until browned and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the 
                chicken to a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden
                spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to 
                a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep the sauce just warm.</li>
            <li>Whisk the Parmigiano Reggiano into the sauce. Add the chicken and cooked pasta and toss well. Season with salt 
                and pepper. Serve hot in heated bowls.</li>
        </ol>
