    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I first discovered the amazing taste of Lamb Chops through <i>LongHorn Steakhouse</i>. They were running a special 
        and I decided to order that instead of the steak. The Lamb Chop is seasoned perfectly and the sauce is the cherry on top!
        I match this with Brussel Sprouts and would order a Long Island Ice Tea. When I'm making this at home I usually have
        water. Anything pairs well with these delicious Lamb Chops!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Australian Lamb Chops</li>
            <li>Canola Oil</li>
            <li>Minced Red Onion</li>
            <li>Chopped Garlic</li>
            <li>Paesley</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Ground Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Wilted spinach and mashed potatoes</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinade your lamb first. Prepare at least one hour to marinade the meat with a mix of canola oil, onion, parsley
                and garlic. Make sure to flip occasionally to ensure all parts are marinated.</li>
            <li>Prepare your grill. You can use sauté pan if grilling indoors or char grill if grilling outdoor. For char grill,
                make sure to have it very hot (around 475-500oF). Hot grill like this will ensure the meat to lock in the juices.
                If grilling indoors, coat your pan with canola oil. Don’t forget to season the meat with pepper and salt.</li>
            <li>Now, start grilling! Place the lamb chops on the grill, making it to be 2-3 minutes for each side.</li>
            <li>Once the meat’s internal temperature reaches 140-145 degrees, you can take the meat from the grill. You can cook 
                longer if you desire to have it well done.</li>
            <li>Serve your lamb on a plate, completed with mashed potatoes and the spinach.</li>
        </ol>

            <li>1/2 cup of white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup of cider vinegar</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>How to make sauce</h4>
