    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I first discovered the amazing taste of Lamb Chops through <i>LongHorn Steakhouse</i>. They were running a special 
        and I decided to order that instead of the steak. The Lamb Chop is seasoned perfectly and the sauce is the cherry on top!
        I match this with Brussel Sprouts and would order a Long Island Ice Tea. When I'm making this at home I usually have
        water. Anything pairs well with these delicious Lamb Chops!</p>
